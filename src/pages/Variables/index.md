There are 3 types of variables in Solidity

- **local**
  - declared inside a function
  - not stored on the blockchain
- **state**
  - declared outside a function
  - stored on the blockchain
- **global** (provides information about the blockchain)

Reading data from a state variable is free.

Writing to a state variable cost transaction fee.

```solidity
