Transactions run on `gas`. You pay `gas price * gas` in Ether.

You specify the gas price.

Transactions with higher gas price will be processed faster.

Unspent gas will be refunded.

There are two upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend
- gas limit set by you (how much you are willing to pay for the transaction)
- maximum amount of gas allowed in a block set by the network

```solidity
{{{Gas}}}
```
