Transactions run on `gas`. You pay `gas price * gas` in Ether.

You specify the gas price.

Transactions with higher gas price will be processed faster.

Unspent gas will be refunded.

There are 2 upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend
- `gas limit` (max amount of gas your willing to use for your transaction, set by you)
- `block gas limit` (max amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network)

```solidity
{{{Gas}}}
```
