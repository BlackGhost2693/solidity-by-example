Solidity supports enumerables and they are useful to model choice and keep track of state.

Enums can be declared outside of a contract.

```solidity
{{{Enum}}}
```

### Declaring and importing Enum

File that the enum is declared in

```solidity
{{{EnumDeclaration}}}
```

File that imports the enum above

```solidity
{{{EnumImport}}}
```
