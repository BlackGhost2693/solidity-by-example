/*
EtherStore is a contract where you can deposit any amount and withdraw at most
1 Ether per week. This contract is vulnerable to re-entrancy attack.
Let's see why.

1. Deploy EtherStore
2. Deposit 1 Ether each from Account 1 (Alice) and Account 2 (Bob) into EtherStore
3. Deploy Attack with address of EtherStore
4. Call Attack.attack sending 1 ether (using Account 3 (Eve)).
   You will get 3 Ethers back (2 Ether stolen from Alice and Bob,
   plus 1 Ether sent from this contract).

What happened?
Attack was able to call EtherStore.withdraw multiple times before
EtherStore.withdraw finished executing.

Here is how the functions were called
- Attack.attack
- EtherStore.deposit
- EtherStore.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- EtherStore.withdraw
- Attack.fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- EtherStore.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)
