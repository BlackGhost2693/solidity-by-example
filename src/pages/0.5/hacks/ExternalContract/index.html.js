<p>In Solidity any address can be casted into specific contract,
even if the contract at the address is not the one being casted.</p>
<p>This can be exploited to hide malicious code. Let&#39;s see how.</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

/*
Let&#39;s say Alice can see the code of Foo and Bar but not Mal.
It is obvious to Alice that Foo.callBar() executes the code inside Bar.log().
However Eve deploys Foo with the address of Mal, so that calling Foo.callBar()
will actually execute the code at Mal.
*/

/*
1. Eve deploys Mal
2. Eve deploys Foo with the address of Mal
3. Alice calls Foo.callBar() after reading the code and judging that it is
   safe to call.
4. Although Alice expected Bar.log() to be execute, Mal.log() was executed.

    Bar bar;

<li>Initialize a new contract inside the constructor</li>
<li>Make the address of external contract <code>public</code> so that the code of the
