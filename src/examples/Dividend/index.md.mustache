- receive payment
- for simplicity, have a fixed distribution of shares
- shareholders can withdraw dividend at any time

We let the user withdraw their dividend. For more information about `Push vs Pull` contract design, check out [here](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)

```solidity
{{{Dividend}}}
